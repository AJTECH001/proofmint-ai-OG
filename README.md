# ProofMint AI


## Overview

ProofMint AI is a pioneering decentralized receipts-as-a-service platform built on 0G's modular AI infrastructure, it addresses the $500B e-waste crisis by issuing tamper-proof, NFT-based receipts. This repository houses two folders: `smartcontract` for Solidity-based blockchain logic and `frontend` for React integration, delivering a scalable solution for sustainable commerce.

## Mission

Our mission is to democratize sustainability data, transforming every purchase into a verifiable step toward a circular economy. By harnessing 0G's decentralized AI ecosystem, ProofMint AI empowers merchants, buyers, and recyclers with transparent, low-cost tools to drive global environmental impact.

## Problem Solved

ProofMint AI tackles the $500B e-waste challenge, where only 22.3% of the 62 million tonnes generated annually is recycled, fueling fraud and economic loss. It eliminates opaque payment disputes and blockchain scalability barriers, offering a trusted, AI-verified system to enhance recycling accountability.

## Solution

ProofMint AI provides an innovative blockchain solution, minting receipts as intelligent NFTs on 0G Chain with secure escrow and recycling rewards. Integrated AI, powered by 0G Compute, verifies sustainability metrics, while 0G Storage ensures scalable data management, creating a robust ecosystem for eco-conscious transactions.

## Process Overview

1. **Receipt Issuance**: Merchants deploy tamper-proof receipts via smart contracts in the `smartcontract` folder.
2. **Escrow & Payment**: Buyers lock funds, released only after AI-verified conditions, managed by `frontend` interfaces.
3. **Recycling Tracking**: Recyclers update lifecycles, triggering AI-analyzed rewards, displayed on the frontend dashboard.
4. **Data Storage**: Receipt metadata is stored on 0G Storage, accessible via frontend queries.
5. **Evolution**: Future waves add INFT traits, enhancing receipt value over time.

## Key Features and Innovation

- **Tamper-Proof Receipts**: Immutable NFTs on 0G Chain for ownership proof.
- **AI Verification**: 0G Compute analyzes recycling data for fraud detection and carbon footprints.
- **INFT Evolution**: Receipts gain dynamic traits (e.g., recycling readiness), a first in sustainability.
- **Role-Based Access**: Smart contracts ensure secure merchant, buyer, and recycler interactions.
- **Scalable Design**: 0G's modular stack supports global adoption without performance bottlenecks.

## Market Opportunity

ProofMint AI taps into the $2.66 trillion circular economy by 2035 (13.57% CAGR), targeting the $500B e-waste segment. With blockchain for sustainable supply chains growing at 35.1% CAGR to $15.9 billion by 2034, it captures a niche in eco-commerce, aiming for a 1% market share ($5B potential) through partnerships with electronics brands and recyclers.

## Technology Stack

- **0G Chain**: Fast, EVM-compatible blockchain for smart contract deployment.
- **0G Storage**: Decentralized, cost-effective storage for receipt data (10-100x cheaper).
- **0G Compute**: AI inference and training for sustainability insights.
- **0G DA**: Scalable data availability for real-time verification.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (0.8.30) in `smartcontract` folder (`ProofMint.sol`, `ZKKYCVerifier.sol`).
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript in `frontend` folder, using Tailwind CSS and RainbowKit for wallet integration.

## Transforming the Economy

ProofMint AI redefines commerce by embedding sustainability into every transaction. By incentivizing recycling with AI-verified rewards, it reduces e-waste, lowers carbon footprints, and creates a marketplace for intelligent assets. This shift drives economic value—projected $5M revenue by 2027—while fostering a greener, decentralized future, positioning 0G as a leader in AI-driven economic transformation.
